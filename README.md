### 🚀 What I'm Working On

I'm currently focused on building and deploying cutting-edge Generative AI applications. Here are some of my recent projects:

-   **[HealthInsight-Bot](https://github.com/AdwaitKulkarni/HealthInsight-Bot)**: A RAG-powered medical Q&A system using Langchain and OpenAI to provide accurate, context-aware answers from a private knowledge base.
-   **[Pill-Pal-Agent](https://github.com/AdwaitKulkarni/Pill-Pal-Agent)**: A multi-modal agent built with Google Gemini that identifies medications from images and uses agentic tools to find detailed information.
-   **[3D-Medical-Image-Reconstruction](https://github.com/AdwaitKulkarni/3D-Medical-Image-Reconstruction)**: An unsupervised deep learning project to generate 3D CT scans from 2D X-ray images using Cycle-GANs and Diffusion Models.
